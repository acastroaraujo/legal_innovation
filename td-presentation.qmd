## Motivation

::: {.incremental .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Sociologists use [citation networks]{.smallcaps} to study innovation, but they mostly focus on "science" (*publications*) or "technology" (*patents*).

    ::: auth-reference
    These networks are embedded in environments that reward novelty and “fresh ideas.”
    :::

-   Reasoning from [precedent]{.smallcaps} means that you are constrained by past decisions. At the extreme, it means that you will have to make—*or at least accept*—decisions that you personally dislike.

    ::: auth-reference
    Doing the "wrong" thing just because it has been done before (e.g., concurring opinions).
    :::

-   Sociologists who study law tend to focus on “external” determinants of legal change (i.e., power, public opinion, electoral politics).

    ::: auth-reference
    Legal reasoning is a black-box.
    :::

## Innovation

::: fragment
**Definition**

An innovative legal argument is any configuration of cultural elements that’s *useful* for judges attempting to decide a [hard case]{.smallcaps}.
:::

:::: fragment
**Dependent Variable**

[Cumulative citation count]{.smallcaps} as an indicator of innovation because it captures the extent to which other judges find a legal argument to be *useful* in deciding future cases.

## Two Hypotheses

::: incremental
-   $H_1$ : Innovative legal arguments rely on the novel combination of legal principles. As such they will contain traces of "principle-based" argumentation.

-   $H_2$ : Innovative legal arguments will contain traces of what @merton1968 calls "adumbration," which is the motivated search for long-forgotten cases that can then be reinterpreted in novel ways, allowing for judges to hide their creative work behind the veil of tradition.

## How it started, how it's going

::: incremental
-   Personal bias

    ::: auth-reference
    Legal innovation usually carries a positive connotation… *in Colombia*
    :::

-   Bad influence

    Needs major re-thinking

# Data {background-color="#4C837B"}

## Colombian Constitutional Court (CCC)

Colombia changed its Constitution in 1991 and created a new high court.

It is a very prolific court (\~ 900 decisions per year).

-   `r scales::comma(nrow(ccc::metadata))` rulings made by the CCC during the `r paste(range(ccc::metadata$year), collapse = "-")` period.

-   Citations to previous decisions, date, type of ruling, keywords, etc.

-   Made publicly available: <https://acastroaraujo.github.io/ccc/>

## Number of decision per year

```{r}
metadata |> 
  filter(year < max(year)) |> 
  count(year) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, n)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "count")
  #scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 1600, by = 200)) #
```

## Citations

```{r}
metadata |> 
  pivot_longer(c(indegree, outdegree), names_to = "dtype", values_to = "degree") |> 
  mutate(dtype = case_when(
    dtype == "indegree" ~ "Average Inward Citations (in-degree)",
    dtype == "outdegree" ~ "Average Outward Citations (out-degree)"
  )) |> 
  ggplot(aes(year, degree)) + 
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = \(x) mean_cl_boot(x, conf.int = 0.68), fatten = 1/2,
    shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 1/10
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~ dtype, ncol = 1) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(1992, 2024, 4), breaks = seq(1992, 2024, 4)) +
  labs(y = NULL, x = NULL) +
  theme(strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
```

## H~1~: "Principle-Based Argumentation" Measurement

::: incremental
-   Create a list of 238 principles and 510 rights.

-   Create a network that links these keywords through their number of common decisions.

-   Count the number of keywords contained within each decision and determine whether each pairing $n \choose 2$ are conventional, unconventional, or neither.

-   Extract types of pairings using a "fixed degree sequence model"

## A *what* model?

```{r}
#| echo: false

fig_svg<- cowplot::ggdraw() + 
  cowplot::draw_image("images/backbone-logic.svg")

plot(fig_svg)
```

## Structure of Principles Joined by "Typical" Ties

![](images/clipboard-796059224.png)

## H~2~: "Adumbration" Measurement

::: incremental
-   Look at the cases contained in each ruling

-   Count the number of days that have passed since each of these references was cited elsewhere.

-   Count the number of "long-forgotten" cases by looking at year-specific thresholds (99^th^ percentile of distribution)

## Results

| Model          | ELPD (difference) | Standard Error (difference) |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| H~1~ and H~2~  | $0.00$            | $0.00$                      |
| Just H~1~      | $-1.11$           | $2.57$                      |
| Just H~2~      | $-427.80$         | $37.21$                     |
| Baseline model | $-431.40$         | $37.33$                     |

<aside>

Baseline model (negative binomial regression):

$$
\log(\lambda) = f\text{(time, outdegree, type, topic)}
$$

## Problems

::: incremental
-   Coefficients are basically uninterpretable

    ::: auth-reference
    E.g., an increase of one standard deviation in the number of “typical parings” (or 4.6 atypical pairings) is associated—all else equal—with a 26% increase in cumulative citation counts
    :::

-   Too many moving parts in measurement of "independent" variables

-   Is innovation really captured by the cumulative citation count? Some hard cases are "hard" precisely because they deal with very *rare* situations.

-   It is *boring!*

-   Ignores the people making the decisions (but more data coming soon).

-   Silence on whether legal principles are (1) “useful decision-making tools” or just (2) “pretty playthings” used to make post-hoc justifications.
